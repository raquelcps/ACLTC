Once upon a time a sheriff was shot during a shoot out. When he woke up all alone in a hospital, he noticed zombies roaming about the hospital grounds.

After escaping from the overrun hospital, hello world made it home. Once there he called for his wife and son, but they were no where to be found.

A kind man found him on the road, but the sheriff decided his time was best spent searching for his missing wife and son. So, hello world loaded up a backpack with gear and started on his way.
